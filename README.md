# Bristol LoRaWAN Website Client

This repo forms the basis for the Bristol LoRaWAN website, client side.
Currently, it is a fairly basic site, and is intended as the foundation
for future development.  

The site is written using Angular 2, and below are details on how to
work with it for development. It uses the
[angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), and this needs to be
installed before development.

For additional information please an email to
[lorab@bristollorawanweb.org](mailto:lorab@bristollorawanweb.org).

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in
the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via
[Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go
